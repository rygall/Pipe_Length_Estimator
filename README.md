Summary:

I am developing this program while I work as a mechanical engineer designing piping systems. I do a lot of day to day calculations that are a bit repititive, so I 
figured why not just develop some software to provide an easy to use GUI where all of my calculations can be done in one place rather than having to jump around 
between different documents and software.



Current Features:

- Pipe Length and Fittings Estimator
    Typically when doing a pressure drop calculation, the pressure drop is being estimated for a system that isnt actually built, and a typical procedure is to take a
    preliminary length, add 25% to that length, and then estimate the standard 90 degree elbows and standard 45 degree elbows that will be the estimated length of 
    pipe. The estimaion is one standard 90 degree elbow and one standard 45 degree elbow for every 8 feet of estimated pipe.
  
- Pressure Drop Calculations
    This feature will take the input of everything needed in order to do a pressure drop calculations through a piping system and output a pressure drop (psi) along 
    with some other useful variables.
    


Future Features:
  
- Unit Conversion for the Following Metrics:
  - Distance
  - Temperature
  - Weight
  - Area
  - Volume
  - Pressure
  - Density
  - Volumetric Flowrate

- Conversion from PSI to Head Pressure for varying Fluids
- Conversion from Head Pressure to PSI for varying Fluids

- Net Positive Suction Head Available (NPSHa) Calculation

- Minimum Pipe Wall Thickness Calculation



Future GUI Features:

- A console to display all results from calculations
