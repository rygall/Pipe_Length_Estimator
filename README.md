This program is being developed to properly estimate the length of piping from a set point A to point B. The routing of piping can vary and when you perform pressure drop calculations, you want to make sure you assume the longest possible length of piping. The reason estimating the length of the piping accurately is that you have to estimate the amount of 90 degree bends in that routing. The 90 degree bends cause noticeable pressure drop.
